# What social problem is being addressed?
We aim to address educational inequity among Asian-American UCLA undergraduate students. Due to various factors such as race, ethnicity, household income, parents' educational background, and more, students enter an uneven playing field when they begin college, and the effects of these gaps have long lasting impacts even beyond college. Mapping out any patterns and trends can potentially give us insight into how these factors may be contributing to students' educational experiences. 

# Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
In addition to empowering students, our mapplication can support educational leaders, nonprofit organizations, and higher education institutions in pushing for education reforms and creating programs that can help current students. 

# What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
Since we intend on collecting data about where people are from, there may be privacy concerns surrounding sharing locations, and another problem we may have is being able to collect data from a well represented sample.
