           <h2>Background</h2>
           <p>
            Educational inequity describes the disparity in academic resources, educational quality, and achievement among 
            students, especially impacting marginalized groups and their opportunities for economic and social mobility. 
            Among racial minorities, achievement gaps correlate with socioeconomic factors such as income gaps, poverty rates, 
            and parents’ educational levels. These gaps starting from preschool form the foundation of students’ experiences 
            as they enter and become integrated in higher education institutions. 

            Currently, Asian-Americans make up a decent percentage of the population at top universities, and overall have the 
            highest level of postsecondary degree attainment. Data like this contributes to the dominating narrative that 
            Asian-American students are doing well in higher education, but oftentimes these data treat Asian-Americans as a 
            monolith. In reality, Asian-Americans vary widely in ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and parental educational 
            background, and lumping them together ignores the diverse array of experiences they each face. Our project will 
            hone in on the stories of Asian-American students at UCLA, who make up about a third of the student body, and how 
            they each are navigating their academic journeys. 
           </p>

           <h2>Long Term Impact</h2>
           <p>
            we desire to transfer back the ownership to the users of the site - Asian American UCLA students who are facing 
            difficulties in colleges as a result of their background. In order to facilitate this, we intend to reach to 
            organizations such as the UCLA Asian-Pacific Coalition and the UCLA First to Go organization. These organizations 
            deal with the Asian American students here, and we think it will be valuable for them to use this application in 
            their efforts of improving the experience of Asian American students. We hope that the experiences that are shared 
            by community members are used in order to tailor resources to better meet the needs of Asian Americans at UCLA.
