## Objective
The objective of our mapplication is to provide a platform for Asian-American UCLA students to share their academic experiences. We also would like to educate the UCLA community and shed light on the diversity of Asian-American Bruin experiences in navigating higher education. 

## Community
Our project is intended for the Asian American student community at UCLA. The community here at UCLA is diverse, with many Asian American students coming from low income and first generation backgrounds. However, the entire community is stereotyped as a "model minority" and are treated as a monolith. This is especially seen with academics, as students are stereotyped as "smart". We want to highlight all the varied and diverse experiences of the community.

  <li>Story Sidepanel</li>
  <img src="./images/sidepanel.png" width="300">
  <p>Upon clicking on a region, the side panel will be populated with all of the responses tied to points within that region, color coded by positive and negative experiences. </p>

  <li>Filter</li>

  <p>Users can filter the markers on the map by positive or negative experiences.</p>

## Future use
With regards to the future of our mapplication, we desire to transfer back the ownership to the users of the site - Asian American UCLA students who are facing difficulties in colleges as a result of their background. In order to facilitate this, we intend to reach out to organizations such as the UCLA Asian-Pacific Coalition and the UCLA First to Go organization. These organizations work with Asian American students, and we think it will be valuable for them to use this application in their efforts of improving the experience of Asian American students. We hope that the experiences that are shared by community members are used in order to tailor resources to better meet the needs of Asian Americans at UCLA. 


## Acknowledgements
Special thank you to our professor, Albert, for teaching ASIAN AM 191A, where we weere able to learn and apply all of the tools we used to build this mapplication. We wouldn't have been able to complete this without his guidance throughout this quarter! We'd also like to thank our classmates for participating in our surveys and giving feedback to help us build the best version of this mapplication.
