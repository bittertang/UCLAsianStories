## Objective
The objective of our mapplication is to provide a platform for Asian-American UCLA students to share their academic experiences. We also would like to educate the UCLA community and shed light on the diversity of Asian-American Bruin experiences in navigating higher education.

## Future use
With regards to the future of our mapplication, we desire to transfer back the ownership to the users of the site - Asian American UCLA students who are facing difficulties in colleges as a result of their background. In order to facilitate this, we intend to reach out to organizations such as the UCLA Asian-Pacific Coalition and the UCLA First to Go organization. These organizations work with Asian American students, and we think it will be valuable for them to use this application in their efforts of improving the experience of Asian American students. We hope that the experiences that are shared by community members are used in order to tailor resources to better meet the needs of Asian Americans at UCLA.
